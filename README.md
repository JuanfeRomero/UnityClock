# UnityClock
My first project made in Unity using a script made in C#
I inserted different pre made 3D objects in Unity to represent the hands for the hour, minute and second of the clock, as well as 12 marks to define the time, with a C# script I controlled the movement of the hands-objects to sync up with the system current time
